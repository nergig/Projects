Piezoelectric Paper Characterization and Application
This is a project I did this summer in Dr. Boris Stoeber's Lab with the piezoelectric paper research group. 

The folder contains the following items:
- Piezoelectric Paper  Characterization and  Sensor Application: Wrap up for all projects. including the fiber content effect on piezopaper's stiffness and piezoelectric response, and piezopaper's application in accelerometer and speaker.
- Peter_poster_final: A poster focus on the fiber content effect on piezopaper's stiffness and piezoelectric response
- Extended Research Abstract: An abstract for the fiber content effect. The abstract explains the research methods and discuss the results.
- videos: 2 interesting video demos for the piezo accelerometer and speaker
- Speaker Optimizition: Tools and results for getting a clear sound from piezospeaker
