The food delivery drone is for a 3D modelling competition. The entire project is finished by Victor Li, Crystal Zheng, Leo Cheng, and Peter Lin. We have finished the drone's body, propeller system, and food container design.

This project folder include:

- MRR Presentation: The presentation slides which introduce our design target and features
- Food Delivery Drone Brainstorm: Our brainstorm process that setup the design targets
- Calculation: Theoretical estimation for different drone designs
- 3d models: 3D models in solidwork and rendered pictures
